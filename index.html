    <h1> Tasneem Bhaijee's Bio</h1>
    <img src=pic.png>

    <p>The ability to turn massive and complex data sets into “actionable insights” may seem like magic.</p>
    <p>But in my role as a Data Analyst I’m more translator than magician.</p>
    <p>My ability to breakdown complex problems into clear, precise and detailed action steps produces roadmaps to project execution, enabling on-time or ahead-of-time completion.
    </p>
    <p>I’m constantly exploring new ways to improve. By applying project documentation of lessons learned to seeking collaborative opportunities across functional teams, I stay open and receptive to novel solutions.</p>
    <p>My management style is enthusiastic and inclusive, and I believe positivity has a ripple effect throughout an organization.</p>
